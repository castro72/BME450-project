## Project decription
Our team’s final project aims to train a neural network on a tabular dataset of clinical features to accurately predict potential heart diseases and heart failure. The open dataset, found on Kaggle, contains 918 total observations of patients’ ages, sex, chest pain types, resting blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar levels, resting ECG results, maximum heart rates, exercise anginas, and indicators of whether or not they have heart disease. Following the training of the neural network, our team plans on modifying the neural network to improve its overall accuracy before testing the results and reporting our findings. There exist a multitude of tools available to manipulate the architecture of the network: batch size, learning rate, momentum, activation functions, BatchNorm, gradient clipping, and a multitude of others. Our team plans on exploring all available options as we optimize our neural network, but we feel that our efforts will be best spent on things like increasing the hidden layers of the neural network, increasing the number of neurons and epochs, weight initialization, and changing the activation functions both within and outside of the output layer of the network. If we have enough time, our team would also like to manipulate the different parameters of the learning algorithm in an attempt to optimize each one. We will continuously perform tests and compare results as we work toward optimizing our neural network. Ultimately, we feel these actions—coupled with adequate time—will improve the accuracy of the neural network we have trained to deliver accurate predictions of potential heart failures of patients when provided with important clinical features and be accurately used to determine if a patient will have heart disease.
